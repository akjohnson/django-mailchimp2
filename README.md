django-mailchimp2
=================

An app for integration Mail Chimp with Django using the 2.0 API.

This is still very much a work in progress, but the first task is
getting the automatic rendering and processing of forms for
subscribing to lists.

Installation
============

* requirements.txt contains the list of needed packages for pip
* MAILCHIMP_API_KEY should be set in Django's settings
* Right now none of the needed templates are included, and will need to be created.
